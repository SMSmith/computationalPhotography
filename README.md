# Computational Photography

The goal of this repository is to display the work completed during 15-463 Computational Photography.  

I will attempt to complete all of the assignments using opencv and python instead of MATLAB which is much less useful in industry.  

## Channel Alignment
The first assignment is channel alignment.  Given RGB color channels, combine them and produce one colored image.  The results are shown here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15463-f15-users/smsmith/proj1/www/

## Eulerian Video Magnification
The second assignment is Eulerian Video Magnification.  The results of this can be found here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15463-f15-users/smsmith/proj2/www/

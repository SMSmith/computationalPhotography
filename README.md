# Computational Photography

The goal of this repository is to display the work completed during 15-463 Computational Photography by Stephen Smith.  

I will attempt to complete all of the assignments using opencv instead of MATLAB which is much less useful in industry.  

The first assignment is channel alignment.  Given RGB color channels, combine them and produce one colored image.  The results are shown here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15463-f15-users/smsmith/proj1/www/

The second assignment is Eulerian Video Magnification.  The results of this can be found here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15463-f15-users/smsmith/proj2/www/
